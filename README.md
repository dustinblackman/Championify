Championify is a little program that downloads all the recent item sets from popular websites like Champion.gg and imports them in to your League of Legends to use within game! No hassle. Championify supports 39 languages and with plenty of new features planned and in the works!

Windows and OSX are both supported, tested on Windows 10 and OSX 10.12.1.

__NOTE__: All Championify clients before version 2.0.0 no longer work. Please download the latest version from the [releases](https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/releases/latest) page.

## Command Line Parameters
Championify supports a few command line parameters for those who would like to automate a few tasks before it's official supported within the app. Params work on both Windows and OSX, and uses the last saved preferences made on the app (preferences are saved each time you hit import). The command line prefs do need improvement and can be tracked [here](https://github.com/dustinblackman/Championify/issues/165).

__Params__

- `--import` Imports item sets
- `--delete` Deletes item sets
- `--autorun` Silently (without loading the UI) imports item sets
- `--close` Closes Championify when finished
- `--start-league` Starts League of Legends after import

__Example__

Silently imports and starts League afterwards after installing Championify with the Windows Installer. As Squirrels
generates the main `championify.exe`, `--processStartArgs` must be used before all other command line options.

```cmd
C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Local\Championify\championify.exe --processStartArgs --autorun --start-league
```

<a name="source" />

## Build From Source
You must have Node 6.9.1 and npm 3 installed on your system (thats what Electron is using), git clone the repo and run the following in the root folder.

__OSX:__
```bash
npm i
npm run build
```

__Windows:__
```bash
npm i --arch=ia32
npm run build
```

You'll find a Championify.exe/Championify.app in the releases folder.

Wine is required if building on Mac for Windows.
```bash
brew install wine
```
